					<p>Are you a whatsapp user? If you answered yes maybe you are wondering if there are better mobile messaging apps you can use. <a href="https://threema.ch/en/">Threema</a>  is a mobile messaging service that provides you more security, because according to Threema all the messages on Threema are encrypted and no one will have access to your messages, except the people you send the messages to. You can also send photos, videos, and several other media with this application. The only bad thing about this application is that it costs 1.99 dollars, but I think that this price is worth it for what you will get in exchange. If you want to get a new way to communicate with your friends choose Threema.  </p>

					<p>As we all know <a href="https://fiber.google.com/about/">Google Fiber</a>  is offering Internet speeds that are around 100 times faster than the average Internet providers. Google recently announced that Google Fiber would potentially expand to <a href="https://fiber.google.com/newcities/">San Jose, Salt Lake City, Portland, Phoenix, San Antonio, Nashville, Charlotte, Atlanta and Raleigh-Durham</a> . Now more people will be able to enjoy this service. Google fibers offers Gigabit Internet for the price of 70 dollars a month, and Gigabit + TV service for 120 a month. With these two plans you also get a TB of storage from Google Drive, so that way you can always have your data backed up on the cloud. Please watch the video below to learn more about Google Fiber in Provo. </p>

					<p>We all know about the new product called <a href="https://onlycoin.com/">Coin</a> , a device you can use to store all your credit cards and put all the data of your cards into one device. <a href="http://www.looppay.com/product/fob/">Loop Fob</a>  is something really similar. It lets you store all your credit cards into one device. The problem with Loop Fob is that the device is so big it cant fit nice in your wallet. One of the advantages of this device is that you can recharge the device and use it as long as you want, where as the battery that comes with Coin lets you use the card just 2 years before it dies, once it dies you have to buy a new coin. If you want to reduce some space in your wallet please consider this device.</p>

It comes integrated with a 4GB media player, and passive noise isolation. You can also track things such as speed, time distance, and cadence. If you want to monitor your health you can also monitor your heart rate, oxygen saturation, body temperature, and calories burned.

					<p>Do you also hate when you have to deal with sliders and other “virtual” buttons on all your desktop applications? Now with <a href="http://www.palettegear.com/"> Palette</a>  we can get rid of this problem. Palette provides real buttons and sliders that can be used with any application on your desktop, and the great thing is that they can be connected in a very simple and modular way. You just have to connect one module via USB and the other modules can be connected to it. These modules feel more realistic, and you can be more precise on what you are doing. Now instead of conforming to control a button with your mouse you can actually press a real button that looks and feels like a real one. Interesting right? </p>

For users that have a windows machine, but need a Linux environment, this distro won’t disappoint. It is really simple to use and very appealing to the eye. You will need at leas 120 GB of free disk space in order to run Elementary OS smoothly. This OS is not very popular, but several tech sites, and YouTube bloggers have recognized it. </p>

Now we have to wait and see what company comes out with the first phone covered in sapphire. </p>

					<p> It looks like Facebook is coming with a new application called “Paper”. This new application will get rid of all the garbage that a lot of people post, and it will show allthe important news in a form that is very similar to a newspaper. Paper will be the first product created from the Facebook creative labs. <br> Creative Labs are creating new ways to connect people and deliver information to Facebook users. I think Facebook took this approach after a <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.4208v1.pdf"> research paper from Princeton University</a> was released, where they say that 80% of the users will stop using facebook. Also if we check <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore#q=facebook">Google Trends</a>  we can see that the interest is declining after reaching its peak in 2012. Anyways it will be an interesting year for facebook, because I’m sure that Paper is not the only thing that will be released this year.</p>

					<p> It seems that SkyDrive, a product from Microsoft is changing name. It looks like Skydrive changed name  to <a href="https://www.onedrive.com"> OneDrive</a> because there was a complaint from the British Sky Broadcasting Group (BSkyB). Microsoft chose OneDrive because there’s going to be just “One” place to store all your files. Users will be able to access files from OneDrive using any mobile device or PC. 
					<br>
					I’ve been using OneDrive to sync all my OneNote documents, and I have to say that it is really convenient to have all my notes stored in a backed-up server. It is great to access my notes using any device I want. Also if I’m traveling and I don’t want to take my laptop, but I need to review some notes, I can take a tablet with me and I still have access to all my files and I can still edit them if I need to. Also having Microsoft’s office web applications on OneDrive is something really convenient.</p>

					<p> We can have 2 Operating systems on our computers like windows and Ubuntu. But now it seems that people is putting more operating systems on their cell phones. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus5/comments/1wc8hc/n5_triple_boot_cataclysm_442_firefox_os_ubuntu/"> A thread on Reddit</a> shows how one person added Firefox and Ubuntu on his cell phone. This sounds like a crazy idea, because this person also mentions that one operating system doesn’t get any cellular data at all, so why even bother to add the new OS at all? I think the Ubuntu OS looks very interesting, and I’m sure all Ubuntu users will love this mobile operating system. I still have some doubts on the Firefox OS though. </p>

					<p>Dash is a New York startup. They offer the opportunity to turn your regular car into a “smart car”. They did this by developing a mobile application called <a href="https://dash.by/">Dash</a>. This app provides to the customer the opportunity to get detailed information about your car. Instead of just looking at a “check engine” light on your dashboard, now you can get the detailed information describing what’s truly wrong with your vehicle. Also Dash will provide you the costs information. I think this is a really great application, because not all drivers have a code reader with them all the time. Also if you have a code reader for your car, you still need to look at the code manual and check what’s wrong with your car. Dash provides you peace of mind and it will make all the driving experience more enjoyable. I’ll definitely buy the equipment and download the app.</p>

					<p>Yesterday 30 years ago was the Macintosh 128k (better known as Apple’s Macintosh) released. If you had 2,495 dollars in your pocket, you could get one of these personal computers. This computer and the commercial by Ridley Scott changed the world from that moment on. 30 years later, Apple created more innovative products, such as the Mac Pro, the MacBook Pro, and the MacBook Air. Let’s see what Apple will release this year, Happy Birthday Mac!</p>
